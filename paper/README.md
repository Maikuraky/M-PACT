### Author Instructions for Paper Submission

If you have questions regarding paper submission and submission system (CMT), please send an email to submission_support@eccv2016.org.

We strongly recommend the use of LaTeX. An MS Word template is also available [here](http://static.springer.com/sgw/documents/1124637/application/zip/CSProceedings_AuthorTools_Word_2003.zip), together with a detailed pdf file describing how to use it.

A complete paper should be submitted using the above templates, which are blind-submission review-formatted templates.

Papers with more than 14 pages (excluding references) will be rejected without review.

### Policies

**Review Process:** By submitting a paper to ECCV, the authors agree to the review process and understand that papers are processed by the Toronto system to match each manuscript to the best possible chairs and reviewers.

**Confidentiality:** The review process of ECCV is confidential. Reviewers are volunteers not part of the ECCV organisation and their efforts are greatly appreciated. The standard practice of keeping all information confidential during the review is part of the standard communication to all reviewers. Misuse of confidential information is a severe professional failure and  appropriate measures will be taken when brought to the attention of ECCV organizers. It should be noted, however, that the organisation of ECCV is not and cannot be held responsible for the consequences when reviewers break confidentiality.

**Double blind review:** ECCV reviewing is double blind, in that authors do not know the names of the area chair/reviewers of their papers, and the area chairs/reviewers cannot, beyond reasonable doubt, infer the names of the authors from the submission and the additional material. Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g., titles in the movies, or attached papers). Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. Violation of any of these guidelines may lead to rejection without review. If you need to cite a different paper of yours that is being submitted concurrently to ECCV, the authors should
  1. cite these papers,
  2. argue in the body of your paper why your ECCV paper is non trivially different from these concurrent submissions, and
  3. include anonymized versions of those papers in the supplemental material.
